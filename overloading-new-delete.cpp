 * Overloading new and delete operator
 * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overloading-new-delete-operator-c/
 * 
 * Can be overloaded globally or for a specific class
 * 
 * Syntax 
 * void* operator new(size_t size);
 * The overloaded new operator receives size of type size_t, 
 * which specifies the number of bytes of memory to be allocated. 
 * The return type of the overloaded new must be void*.
 * The overloaded function returns a pointer to the beginning of the block of memory allocated.
 * 
 * void operator delete(void*);
 * The function receives a parameter of type void*
 * which has to be deleted.
 * Function should not return anything.
 * 
 * NOTE: Both overloaded new and delete operator functions are static members by default. 
 *       Therefore, they donâ€™t have access to this pointer .
